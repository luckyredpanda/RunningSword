This is a project of Praktikum, we designed a game with a doomsday survival theme story to motivate people come out and run. In this project, we six members as a team designed and realized an android based game which use osmdroid, nodejs, mongodb. It is a front-end separation project. We finished all mandatory features like secure login, profile system, friend system, single play and multi-play system. Furthermore, we designed a comment system to let users appraise each other. We also conceived and implemented a coin system which can let users skip if they have difficulty in finishing task of a specific day. 

这是一个实训项目，我们设计了一款以世界末日生存为主题的游戏，以激励人们在lockdown的情况下出去跑步。 在这个项目中，我们六个成员作为一个团队，设计并实现了一个基于android的游戏，使用了osmdroid、nodejs、mongodb。它是一个前端分离项目。我们完成了所有强制性功能，如安全登录、个人资料系统、好友系统、单人游戏和多人游戏系统。此外，我们设计了一个评论系统，让用户相互评价。我们还构思并实施了一个硬币系统，如果用户在完成特定日期的任务时遇到困难，可以让他们跳过。




**IMPORTANT**: `start.sh` must have LF line endings. Sometimes when cloning/copying on different systems this will be set to CRLF or CR. Then the installation will fail! Also `start.sh` needs `chmod +x start.sh`.

The commands from `start.sh` can also be run manually in the CLI of express service.

If ws service is exiting try to run `docker-compose up express` first, then stop it when it is done and run `docker-compose up` again.
